# CF11-FrontEnd-2

Project based on core technologies; HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular

As a team of 4, and using Angular, we made a website that included things such as a shopping cart, list of items, links to individual item descriptions, and others.  

  This time, and as we already had some experience creating multiple-component websites with Angular, we focused more on the layout and the appearance of the website.
  
To get the project running locally, you must have angular dependencies installed in your local machine (https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)
