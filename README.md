# CoreTech-Project
Project based on core technologies; HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular


As a team of 4, and using Angular, we made a website that included things such as a shopping cart, list of items, links to individual item descriptions, and others.
This time, and as we already had some experience creating multiple-component websites with Angular, we focused more on the layout and the appearance of the website.
